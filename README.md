# Fashion-MNIST-Image-Classification-
This project uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset into 10 clothing categories.

### ðŸ§© Methods
- Dataset: Fashion MNIST (60,000 train / 10,000 test images)
- Model: CNN and ResNet18 (PyTorch)
- Frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras, or PyTorch
- Accuracy: 87% (ResNet18)

### ðŸ“Š Results
- Accuracy curve and confusion matrix are included in `/results`.
- Model shows good generalization on unseen test data.
